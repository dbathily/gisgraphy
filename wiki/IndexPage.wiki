=About me=

Hi all, my name is David Masclet, i am  developer and i really like GIS and all the stuff around it (see my <a href="http://davidmasclet.free.fr/" target="_blank" >CV</a> in french). I also like agility (SCRUM,XP).

I have started gisgraphy on november 2007, the initial goal of the project was to offer a free, opensource and easy way to use Geonames data.

Step by step, i have build the framework, first an importer with an IHM, then a geolocalisation and a fulltext webservice, a back officewith statistics, ...

Then i thought that an opensource geocoder can be useful, so i extends the framework with an importer for Openstreetmap and develop a webservice too.

My goal was to : 
  * provide and support a lot of languages (XML, json, PHP, ruby, python, Atom, RSS / GeoRSS , more to come) 
  * A high quality software with High test coverage 
  * Easy to install, (a minimum to configure to configure)
  * fully internationalize, with a lot of language supported
  * provide an opensearch module

I hope it is the case. i am currently the only developer.
